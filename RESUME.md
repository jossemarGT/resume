I enjoy working in the technology industry because it allows me to learn through
research, experimentation, and community building. Although I prefer designing
solutions, I value the lessons from my engineering management days, particularly
that we must prioritize the human aspect before addressing complex problems with
bits and bytes.

## Work Experience

### Senior Lead Engineer

**CTO.ai**
*Jun. 2022 - Currently*

- Reestablished the value stream delivery process by resolving the blockers from
  the 2022 initiatives by establishing clear communication and delivery
  guidelines while enhancing engineering culture. This involved encouraging best
  practice sharing, consensus-building, and setting clear expectations between
  the delivery team and company leaders.
- Led the research and development efforts to enhance the platform with
  cloud-native technologies. This included:
  - Migrating a part of the core platform to standalone Kubernetes operators
    that can be used independently on the customer's clusters.
  - Creating proof of concepts for new capabilities, such as integrating a
    standalone buildkit and extending open-source clients for external OCI
    builds and caching.
- Enhanced the platform's reliability by periodically updating the main
  dependencies of the infrastructure, such as upgrading Kubernetes clusters from
  version 1.19 to 1.26, while also reducing 30% cloud costs by staying compliant
  and eliminating redundant or unused resources.
- Aided the company in forming a partnership with a third-party cloud provider,
  enabling users to access the platform seamlessly. This was achieved by
  programmatically extending our identity provider, Keycloak, to support the
  third-party Single Sign-On protocol.

### DevOps Techlead

**3Pillar Global / SUSE**
*Dec. 2021 - May 2022*

- Reduced the [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) release time by collaborating on the
  documentation and automation of the existing processes alongside the different
  teams involved. At the same time, still manually assisting with the releases
  for RKE2 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23 and patching several internal components.
- Improved QA test reliability by augmenting the existing drone CI pipelines and
  tooling to generate snapshot rpms with RKE2 binaries per revision commit.
- Eased the learning curve of new SUSE Rancher consultants by documenting,
  breaking down concepts, and training about their core products, team's ways of
  working, and release processes.

### Engineering Manager - MTS2

**PayPal**
*Sep. 2020 - Nov. 2021*

- We streamlined the creation and refresh of the QA environment, which relies on
  a custom provisioning process and management of applications' configurations
  per environment. This reduced costs associated with unused infrastructure and
  saved time for the development team.
- We aligned Xoom CI practices with PayPal by adopting their ways of working
  while sharing our own through portable, opinionated, and reproducible
  pipelines and tooling. At the same time, we still provided support to 200+
  engineers on their day to day CI enquires. This helped to get towards a
  homogeneous way of working across business units.
- We established clear standards for managing infrastructure as code in our new
  cloud provider, Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This foundation was essential for
  the Xoom GCP migration, as it provided all infrastructure engineering teams
  with a unified approach and defined exceptions.

### Tooling Engineer - MTS1

**Xoom, a Paypal Service**
*Mar. 2015 - Sep. 2020*

- Reduced time to production for new applications from two months to five
  minutes by improving the CI and deployment processes, which build and
  provision the applications based on insights derived from the codebase or
  developer-provided metadata.
- Developed and implemented a unified method for provisioning static and dynamic
  application configurations via a binary in application containers. This
  approach is now used in over 200 production applications and has become the
  standard for new applications.
- Researched and prototyped methods to unify software development processes.
  Consequently, our team standardized the development of applications and
  infrastructure-as-code components using CI pipelines, templates, guidelines,
  development tools, and the adoption of emerging technologies.

### Co-Founder

**Self-funded startup**
*Jan. 2014 - Dec. 2014*

- We identified that our target market, small businesses, face challenges in
  easily creating websites. Often, the process is either too complex or requires
  a significant investment relative to their average income. In response, we set
  the goal of developing a simple way for these businesses to build websites by
  simply answering questions and providing their Facebook page URL.
- We developed a proof of concept using a WordPress multisite, which included
  premium website themes and a set of custom plugins created from scratch. This
  was done to present our idea to peers at the "Centro Municipal de
  Emprendimiento" and to small businesses we visited door to door.
- Designed and built a minimal viable product using Node.js and a basic Angular
  single-page application, gaining the adoption of several freemium users.

### Full Stack and Hybrid Mobile Developer

**Freelance**
*Dec. 2010 - Mar. 2015*

- Led development teams as a consultant by designing and establishing the
  foundational code for multiple custom platforms, such as a back office for a
  trading firm or a CRM built from the ground up.
- Created several WordPress themes and hybrid mobile applications, primarily as
  proof of concept, to meet specific demands from local referrals or gigs from
  freelancing websites.
