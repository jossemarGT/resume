I enjoy working in the technology industry because it allows me to learn through
research, experimentation, and community building. Although I prefer designing
solutions, I value the lessons from my engineering management days, particularly
that we must prioritize the human aspect before addressing complex problems with
bits and bytes.

## Work Experience

### Senior Lead Engineer

**CTO.ai**
*Jun. 2022 - Currently*

- Established communication and process guidelines for the engineering team,
  which improved collaboration performance and culture, allowing us to overcome
  blockers from the 2022 initiatives.
- Led the research and development efforts to enhance the product with
  cloud-native technologies. This included:
  - Migrating a part of the core platform to standalone Kubernetes operators
    that can be used independently. This initiative enhanced portability,
    enabling customers to run the solution on their own.
  - Developed proof of concepts, such as using ephemeral buildkit services with
    modified open-source clients, showcasing efficiency improvements, and
    highlighting technology investment needs.
- Enhanced platform reliability by upgrading Kubernetes clusters from v1.19 to
  v1.26 and maintaining other critical infrastructure components. This reduced
  the cloud costs by 30% through compliance and resource optimization.
- Facilitated the partnership with a third-party cloud provider by extending
  Keycloak to support Single Sign-On, which enhanced user adoption through a
  seamless sign-up process.

### DevOps Techlead

**3Pillar Global / SUSE**
*Dec. 2021 - May 2022*

- Improved [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) release time by collaborating in the
  documentation and automation of the existing cross-team processes.
- Enhanced QA test reliability by improving drone CI pipelines and tools to
  generate snapshot RPMs with RKE2 binaries per revision commit.
- Streamlined 3Pillar consultant onboarding by documenting and breaking down
  concepts while training them on core products, team processes, and release
  procedures.

### Engineering Manager - MTS2

**PayPal**
*Sep. 2020 - Nov. 2021*

- Aligned Xoom's CI practices with PayPal's standards through portable and
  reproducible pipelines, and supported 200+ engineers daily, fostering a
  unified workflow across business units.
- Reduced operational costs and aligned infrastructure teams with the company
  strategy by defining and implementing infrastructure as code standards,
  enabling a seamless GCP migration and unified workflow.
- Saved developer and quality assurance engineers hours by automating the
  orchestration process for QA environment setup and application provisioning.

### Tooling Engineer - MTS1

**Xoom, a Paypal Service**
*Mar. 2015 - Sep. 2020*

- Reduced time to production for new applications from two months to five
  minutes by enhancing CI and deployment processes, leveraging codebase insights
  and developer-provided metadata.
- Created a unified provisioning method for static and dynamic application
  configurations in containers, now standard in over 200 production applications
  and new projects.
- Researched and prototyped unified software development methods, leading my
  team to standardize application and infrastructure-as-code development using
  CI pipelines, templates, guidelines, tools, and emerging technologies.

### Co-Founder

**Self-funded startup**
*Jan. 2014 - Dec. 2014*

- We found that small businesses struggle with complex and costly website
  creation. To address this, we developed an easy solution that lets them build
  websites by answering questions and providing their Facebook page URL.
- We developed a proof of concept using a WordPress multisite with premium
  themes and custom-built plugins, then validated by presenting our idea to
  peers and small businesses through door-to-door visits.
- Developed the business idea MVP with Node.js and a basic Angular SPA,
  successfully attracting several freemium users.

### Full Stack and Hybrid Mobile Developer

**Freelance**
*Dec. 2010 - Mar. 2015*

- As a consultant, led development teams in designing and establishing
  foundational code for multiple custom platforms, including a trading firm's
  back office and a CRM built from scratch.
- Developed multiple WordPress themes and hybrid mobile applications, tailored
  to meet specific demands from local referrals and freelancing gigs, improving
  customers' online presence and helping them bootstrap several business ideas.
