# Jonnatan Jossemar Cordero

I am a maker who truly enjoys learning, teaching, creating, and experimenting. I
believe sound engineers do not solely focus on their tech-related skills but
instead grow alongside those around them.

## Work Experience

### 3Pillar Global / SUSE

| **DevOps Techlead**
| Dec. 2021 - Currently
| As a 3Pillar DevOps consultant, I had the opportunity to help the
[SUSE Rancher](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-rancher/) team automate their
release and delivery processes for [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/), a
government-level secure and FIPS compliant Kubernetes distribution.

### PayPal

| **Infrastructure Engineering Manager - MTS2**
| Sep. 2020 - Nov. 2021
| Supporting the Build and Orchestration team as a corporative leader while
driving Xoom's CI/CD platforms and processes converge with PayPal. I must say,
helping my team to grow and learning alongside them has been the best part.

### Xoom, a Paypal Service

| **Senior Infrastructure Tooling Engineer - MTS1**
| Mar. 2015 - Sep. 2020
| I contributed within the Infrastructure Tooling team to reach the ultimate
goal of *reducing the software development cycle time from whiteboard to
production* by automating everyday tasks, re-structuring human processes, and
defining deployment models using immutable infrastructure and continuous
delivery concepts within a hybrid cloud.

### Sait Nao

| **Co-Founder**
| Jan. 2014 - Dec. 2014
| Alongside a college friend, we took the challenge of raising a startup that
had the primary goal of helping small businesses to enhance their online
presence quickly and fast with a self-serve experience. The platform was a
website builder that retrieved all the required content and metadata from the
small business' Facebook page, and then it was a matter of putting a domain in
front of it.


### jossemarGT

| **Consultant and Freelance Full Stack/Hybrid Mobile Developer**
| Dec. 2010 - Mar. 2015
| Worked on several projects regardless of their programming language.
