# Jossemar Cordero

I enjoy working in the technology industry because it allows me to learn through
research, experimentation, and community building. Although I prefer designing
solutions, I value the lessons from my engineering manager days, particularly
that we must prioritize the human aspect before addressing complex problems with
technology.

## Work Experience

### CTO.ai

**Senior Lead Engineer**
*Jun. 2022 - Currently*

Initially, I joined the team as an engineering manager, where I had the
opportunity to improve the engineering culture, enhance the delivery process,
and address communication challenges within the engineering crew. Once the team
was aligned to the company's needs, I transitioned to an individual contributor
role, where my responsibilities included designing, implementing, and
maintaining components for our polyglot ecosystem that operates on Kubernetes
and serverless platforms while striving to enhance the platform’s reliability.

### 3Pillar Global / SUSE Rancher

**DevOps Techlead**
*Dec. 2021 - May 2022*

As a 3Pillar DevOps consultant, I had the privilege of collaborating with the
[SUSE Rancher](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-rancher/) team to automate
their release and delivery procedures for [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) and
[K3S](https://k3s.io/) Kubernetes distributions. Accomplishing this required an
extensive understanding of Kubernetes, the existing team's delivery practices,
and how organizations manage their value stream by creating and maintaining Open
Source Software.

### PayPal

**Infrastructure Engineering Manager - MTS2**
*Sep. 2020 - Nov. 2021*

While leading the Build and Orchestration team, we worked to align Xoom’s CI/CD
platforms, practices, and processes with those of PayPal. My main focus was to
support my team in their continuous learning, growth, and delivery, which
enabled us to keep our internal platforms fully operational for over 200
engineers while transitioning into new ways of working.

### Xoom, a Paypal Service

**Infrastructure Tooling Engineer - MTS1**
*Mar. 2015 - Sep. 2020*

As part of the Xoom Infrastructure Tooling team, we transformed our company's
product delivery by adopting new technologies, automating tasks, restructuring
processes, and utilizing immutable infrastructure and continuous delivery
concepts in a hybrid cloud model.

### Sait Nao

**Co-Founder**
*Jan. 2014 - Dec. 2014*

My business partner and I embraced the challenge of launching a self-funded
startup focused on helping small businesses improve their online presence
through a simple self-service experience. While we successfully developed a
proof of concept and attracted a number of freemium users, we were unable to
scale to the break-even point. Ultimately, we decided to part ways, but we came
away with valuable lessons in software design and delivery, customer
acquisition, and the various roles one must take on in a startup.

### jossemarGT

**Full Stack and Hybrid Mobile Freelance Developer**
*Dec. 2010 - Mar. 2015*

I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects across
multiple programming languages. My experiences include independently developing
websites, implementing tailormade CRM, e-commerce sales platforms, and hybrid
mobile applications.
