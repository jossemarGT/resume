# Jonnatan Jossemar Cordero

I am a maker who truly enjoys learning, teaching, creating, and experimenting. I
believe that complex problems must be first solved at the human level and then
at the technological one.

## Work Experience

### CTO.ai

**Senior Lead Platform Engineer**
*Jun. 2022 - Currently*

Alongside the platform team, we are pursuing better practices and redefining
our delivery/communication processes. With the sole goal of improving the
engineering culture, which positively impacts the product development velocity,
reliability, and visibility.

### 3Pillar Global / SUSE Rancher

**DevOps Techlead**
*Dec. 2021 - May 2022*

As a 3Pillar DevOps consultant, I had the opportunity to assist the
[SUSE Rancher](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-rancher/) team to automate
their release and delivery processes for [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) and
[K3S](https://k3s.io/) Kubernetes distributions.

### PayPal

**Infrastructure Engineering Manager - MTS2**
*Sep. 2020 - Nov. 2021*

As a corporative leader, I supported the Build and Orchestration team while we
drove Xoom's CI/CD platforms and processes to converge with PayPal ones. The
most important tasks in this role were all the ones that allowed the team to
keep learning, growing, improving, and delivering.

### Xoom, a Paypal Service

**Infrastructure Tooling Engineer - MTS1**
*Mar. 2015 - Sep. 2020*

Alongside the Xoom Infrastructure Tooling team, we were able to disrupt how a
whole company delivers its product by adopting new technologies, automating
everyday tasks, re-structuring human processes, and defining deployment models
using immutable infrastructure and continuous delivery concepts within a hybrid
cloud.

### Sait Nao

**Co-Founder**
*Jan. 2014 - Dec. 2014*

Alongside a college friend, we took the challenge of raising a self-funded
startup with the primary goal of helping small businesses enhance their online
presence quickly and simply with a self-serve experience.

### jossemarGT

**Consultant and Freelance Full Stack/Hybrid Mobile Developer**
*Dec. 2010 - Mar. 2015*

Working independently, I had the opportunity to contribute to several projects
regardless of their programming language. From implementing websites and CMS
themes to supporting teams while creating CRMs and hybrid mobile applications.
