# Jonnatan Jossemar Cordero

I am a maker who truly enjoys learning, teaching, creating, and experimenting. I
believe that complex problems must be solved at the human level first, and then
we can start discussing technology.

## Work Experience

### CTO.ai

**Senior Lead Platform Engineer**
*Jun. 2022 - Currently*

As an individual contributor, my responsibilities include designing,
implementing, and maintaining components for our polyglot ecosystem that
operates on top of Kubernetes and serverless platforms using various programming
languages such as JavaScript, Go, Java, and Rust. Additionally, I keep track of
our projects, lead cross-team communications, empower my colleagues, and strive
to improve the platform's reliability.

### 3Pillar Global / SUSE Rancher

**DevOps Techlead**
*Dec. 2021 - May 2022*

As a 3Pillar DevOps consultant, I had the privilege of working with the
[SUSE Rancher](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-rancher/) team to automate
their release and delivery procedures for [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) and
[K3S](https://k3s.io/) Kubernetes distributions. Accomplishing this required an
extensive understanding of Kubernetes, its fundamental components, and how
organizations manage their value stream by creating and maintaining Open Source
Software.

We, the Build and Orchestration team, drove Xoomâ€™s CI/CD platforms, practices,

regard were the ones that enabled my team to constantly learn, grow, improve,
and achieve their goals.

### Xoom, a Paypal Service

As part of the Xoom Infrastructure Tooling team, we transformed our company's
product delivery by adopting new technologies, automating tasks, restructuring
processes, and utilizing immutable infrastructure and continuous delivery
concepts in a hybrid cloud model.

### Sait Nao

We took on the challenge of creating a self-funded startup to help small
businesses enhance their online presence with a simple self-serve experience.

### jossemarGT

**Full Stack and Hybrid Mobile Freelance Developer**
