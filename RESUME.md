I enjoy working in the technology industry because it allows me to learn through
research, experimentation, and community building. Although I prefer designing
solutions, I value the lessons from my engineering management days, particularly
that we must prioritize the human aspect before addressing complex problems with
bits and bytes.

## Work Experience

### Senior Lead Engineer

**CTO.ai**
*Jun. 2022 - Currently*

I joined the company as the engineering manager for the product team, where I
reshaped the culture, improved our delivery processes, and addressed
communication challenges across the company. After aligning the team with the
company's goals, I transitioned to an individual contributor role, focusing in
the research, development, and maintenance of key components in our polyglot
platform.

### DevOps Techlead

**3Pillar Global / SUSE**
*Dec. 2021 - May 2022*

As a 3Pillar DevOps consultant, I had the privilege of collaborating with the
[SUSE Rancher](https://www.suse.com/products/rancher/) team to automate
their release and delivery procedures for [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) and
[K3S](https://k3s.io/) Kubernetes distributions. This effort demanded a deep
understanding of Kubernetes, the team's current delivery practices, and how
organizations manage their value streams while creating and maintaining Open
Source Software.

### Engineering Manager - MTS2

**PayPal**
*Sep. 2020 - Nov. 2021*

While leading the Build and Orchestration team, we worked to align Xoomâ€™s CI/CD
platforms, practices, and processes with those of PayPal. My objective was to
support my team in their continuous learning, growth, and delivery, which
enabled us to keep our internal platforms fully operational for over 200
engineers while transitioning into new ways of working.

### Tooling Engineer - MTS1

**Xoom, a Paypal Service**
*Mar. 2015 - Sep. 2020*

As part of the Tooling team, we transformed our company's product delivery by
adopting new technologies, automating repetitive tasks, restructuring processes,
embracing immutable infrastructure principles within a hybrid clod and creating
developer tools for their day to day workflows.

### Co-Founder

**Sait Nao**
*Jan. 2014 - Dec. 2014*

My business partner and I launched a self-funded startup to help small
businesses improve their online presence with a simple self-service tool.
Although we managed to attract freemium users with our minimun viable product,
we couldn't reach break-even. This gave us great experience about software
design, customer acquisition, and startup functions.

### Full Stack and Hybrid Mobile Developer

**Freelance**
*Dec. 2010 - Mar. 2015*

I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects across
multiple programming languages. My experiences include independently developing
websites, implementing tailormade CRM, e-commerce sales platforms, and hybrid
mobile applications.
