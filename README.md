# jossemarGT résumé

The [right word](http://english.stackexchange.com/a/61341) is résumé but it can
be called CV as well. You can read mine [here](RESUME.md) on github (just the
essential) or look [here](http://jossemargt.github.io/resume) for a more elegant
`html` version.

## FAQ

### Why did you write your resume in markdown?

Because is easy to maintain and publish it as plain text on github :octocat:

### How did you made it?

1.  Write resume in markdown notation.
2.  `./build.sh`
4.  ???
5.  Profit

### I want to write one like yours, may I fork this repo?

Since this is a public repository you could do it, but taking in account that it
has my information the idea sounds kind of creepy... So, how about using
[tajmone/gh-themes-magick](https://github.com/tajmone/gh-themes-magick) pandoc ported
gh-themes as boilerplate instead? (just like I did).

### Can I haz docz?

Sure thing, these resources helped me out to create everything you see in this repository
