# jossemarGT résumé

It seems the right word is [résumé](http://english.stackexchange.com/a/61341),
but it can be called CV as well `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`, either case you can read mine in a
plain old markdown fashion [here on GitHub](RESUME.md), download it as PDF
from the [releases page](https://github.com/jossemarGT/resume/releases/latest)
or even take a look to the more refined version
[here](http://jossemargt.github.io/resume).

## FAQ

### Why did you write your resume in markdown?

Because it is easier to maintain and publish it as plain text on GitHub :octocat:

### How did you made it?

1. Write resume in markdown notation.
2. `./build.sh`
3. ???
4. Profit

### I want to write one like yours, may I fork this repository?

Instead, I suggest using
[tajmone/gh-themes-magick](https://github.com/tajmone/gh-themes-magick)
pandoc ported gh-themes as boilerplate instead, then take it from there.

### Can I haz docz?
